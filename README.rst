Description
-----------

TreeSim_Lpy is a tree modelling tool which is built upon L-py with the added features of pruning and tying trees down to mimic different tree architectures such as Upright fruiting offshoot, V-Trellis, etc. 

Applications
------------
Learning to Prune Branches in Modern Tree-Fruit Orchard - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11128361

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is provided at `Read the Docs <https://osurobotics.github.io/lpy_treesim/>

You can find the latest L-Py documentation at <https://lpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest>

Docker GUI (noVNC) and activating the `lpy` environment
-------------------------------------------------------

You can run TreeSim inside a Docker container that provides a virtual X display and noVNC (a browser VNC client).
This container also provides a conda environment named ``lpy`` containing the required LPy packages.

Build the Docker image (recommended tag: ``lpy-treesim:ubuntu22``):

.. code-block:: bash

   docker build -t lpy-treesim:ubuntu22 .

Run the container (detached), mounting your local cloned workspace:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Mount the entire local repo to /app for editable install
   docker run -d --name lpy-gui -p 6080:6080 -p 5900:5900 -v ${PWD}:/app lpy-treesim:ubuntu22

This mounts your local cloned workspace (with all files like ``.git``, ``README.rst``, etc.) to ``/app``. The entrypoint installs the package in editable mode from the mounted code, so local changes are reflected immediately without rebuilding.

Connect to the GUI with your browser:

 - Visit: ``http://localhost:6080/vnc.html?host=localhost&port=6080``
 - A desktop session with fluxbox and Xvfb will start, along with an xterm terminal.

To verify the environment is active inside the container:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Should print 'lpy' if activated
   echo $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV
   python -c "import openalea.lpy; print('openalea.lpy import ok')"

NOTE: You can copy and paste content in noVNC using the clipboard menu in the left bar and middle click (mouse button) to paste in the terminal.

See the repository Dockerfile for more details about the installed packages and build steps.

Making your first tree
----------------------
To create your first tree using TreeSim_Lpy, in the NoVNC window with the terminal with L-Py activated, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash
   python treesim_lpy/tree_generation/make_n_trees.py --num_trees 1 --output_dir ./dataset

This should create a dataset folder in the current directory with one generated tree mesh in it. It should be available locally on your host machine in the cloned repository folder.

Features
--------

- **Pruning:** Remove unwanted branches to simulate pruning.
- **Branch Tying:** Simulate branches being tied down to mimic different orchard architectures.
- **Labelling:** Get instance and semantic segmentation labels of the mesh
